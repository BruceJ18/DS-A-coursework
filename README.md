# DS-A-coursework
A collection of course work for data structures and algorithms I completed in Java. 

everything from building Dynammic Arrays to Hash tables. I am currently completeting the course work for binary trees and other non linear data structures. I do though have some of those other data structures in my python DS&A repository. 

If your asking me why am I completeting course work that is of the same material in different programming languages, well, it is because in my opinion they are actually not the same, for instance Python does not have simple arrays they have Dynammic Arrays that are not even called arrays they are called lists. To add to that, using another programming language, in my opinion, will greatly solidify these concepts.
