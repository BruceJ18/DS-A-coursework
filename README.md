# DS-A-coursework
A collection of course work for data structures and algorithms I completed in Java. 

update 1:

everything from building Dynammic Arrays to Hash tables. I am currently completeting the course work for binary trees and other non linear data structures. I do though have some of those other data structures in my python DS&A repository. 

update 2:
implemented all linear data structures and non-linear data structures along with some of the traversal methods such as inorder, preorder, and postorder.
