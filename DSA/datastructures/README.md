# DS-A-coursework
A collection of course work for data structures and algorithms I completed in Java. 

I wanted a more solid understanding of the inner workings of data structures and how algorithms are designed so I took a course that layed them out perfectly.
In this course I had plenty of opportunities to test out my java skills and to truly understand its syntax along with the benefit of also understanding dsa's.
I went through simple linear data structures like arrays and hash tables and eventually got to non linear data structures (Binary Trees or Graphs).
The next section had to do with searching and sorting algorithms from binary search to jump sort.
